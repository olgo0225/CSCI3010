Welcome to CandyLand 2.0!

To start the game, press "Start".  Then, use the slider to choose
between 2-4 players. Once you have selected the desired number of
players, it is Player 1's turn and they will draw a card by pressing
"Draw Card".

A player can receive an upgrade in two different ways.  If a player
lands on a tile with a circle in the upper left hand corner, they
receive a skip upgrade and will be able to press the "Skip Turn"
button if they draw an undesired card during their move.  This
upgrade can be used at any time during the game.  The second upgrade
is received when a player draws an upgrade card.  These are disguised
as normal cards. The player will be able to press the "Move 5" button
and move forward 5 spaces as a replacement for their turn.
  
If the player does not have any upgrades or chooses not to use one,
they will press "Move Player" after drawing a card to move their player
to the nearest tile with that color.  In addition to regular cards,
there are also location cards that transport the current player to the
tile with the same shape and color as the card.  This can be a move up
or a move down for the player depending on the location of the tile.

The goal of the game is to reach the upper left hand corner of the game
board before any of the other players.  However, you must get the exact
color of the ending tile to win.  If at any time the game you
choose to end the game, press "End Game" and the game will be stopped.
To start a new game, press "New Game".

Good Luck!
